The code we are talking about here resides on exp-aug branch

1. Download datasets at the highest level of the project from the link
   provided:

2. If you want to sample a different dataset, use the script 
   augmentation/sample_data.py.

3. Go to your non-augmented set that you want to augment and run the scripts
   in the script directory. First, the one that starts with 1. and second the
   one that starts with 2.

After this step, the control (non-augmented) set is ready to be run.

4. But, you also want its twin, the augmented set. For that run
   augmentation/augment_file.py. CHECK THE PATHS BEFORE YOU RUN.

5. Go to your augmented set and run the scripts in the script directory. First,
   the one that starts with 1. and second the one that starts with 2.

After this step, the augment set is ready to be run.

Actually running the experiments:

6. Go to the highest level meaning that you are in the wilds/:

    - If you want to run control:
        python examples/run_expt.py --root_dir data500 --log_dir $HOME/logs --dataset py150 --algorithm ERM --seed 0 --lr 8e-5 --weight_decay 0
    
    - If you want to run augmented:
        python examples/run_expt.py --root_dir data500-aug --log_dir $HOME/logs --dataset py150 --algorithm ERM --seed 0 --lr 8e-5 --weight_decay 0
